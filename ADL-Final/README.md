# Abstract
This research report employs supervised learning and reinforcement learning from machine learning to develop and train a "SalesBot" that can achieve "topic transition through dialogue." A total of five models were used for dialogue data generation and training, namely Facebook's blenderbot-400M-distill, the GPT2 series models Aeona, DialoGPT-medium, Distilled-GPT2, and Google's well-known pre-trained model T5 (small).

The experimental results indicate that the key factor affecting the keyword hit rate is not the model architecture but the pre-training data. Ultimately, the best performance in this experiment was achieved by the blenderbot trained using supervised learning, while other models may require larger, more diverse data sets and longer training times to reach similar results.
